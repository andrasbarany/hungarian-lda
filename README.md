# Hungarian long-distance object agreement

This repository contains data on long-distance object agreement in Hungarian
associated with a paper to appear in a special volume.

The data are contained in `data.ods`, an [Open
Document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument) spreadsheet file. It
contains the full data set used for the paper, including the searches of the
[MNSZ](http://mnsz.nytud.hu/), as well as additional examples from the internet
with their sources.

`notes-on-lda-in-hungarian.R` includes statistical tests run on the data from
`data.ods` but not included in the paper.
